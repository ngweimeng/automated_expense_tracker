## *About the Project*

### ðŸŽ¯ Motivation
Keeping track of expenses and savings has always been a challenge for me. I tried off-the-shelf budgeting apps and even Excel, but manual data entry felt too cumbersomeâ€”and I inevitably fell off the wagon. So I decided to build my own tailored solution that automates as much as possible and gives me clear, timely insights into my spending habits.

### ðŸ”§ How It Works
1. **Automated Extraction**  
   - Connects to your Gmail via the Gmail API  
   - Scrapes transaction details from Instarem and Wise email receipts  
   - Automatically imports those records into your dashboard  

2. **Recurring Transactions**  
   - Define any regular payments (e.g., subscriptions, rent)  
   - The app will auto-add them on the schedule you choose  

3. **Manual Entry**  
   - For one-off or non-email transactions (e.g., peer-to-peer transfers)  
   - Add them quickly via a simple form
