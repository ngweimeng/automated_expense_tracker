### ðŸŽ¯ Motivation
I wanted an easy way to scan my credit card transactions without manually entering each one, since I tend to be lazy and often forget.

### ðŸ”§ Get Started
1. **Settings**  
   Upload PDF statements & manage your transaction categories  
2. **Dashboard**  
   Explore summaries, trends over time, and high-spend alerts
