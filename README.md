# WeiMengâ€™s Budget Tracker

A Streamlit app that automatically ingests, categorizes, and visualizes your credit-card (and other) transactions. Minimize manual data entry required for the chronically busy (or forgetful).

## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation

Manually logging every expense is tediousâ€”and all too easy to fall behind. This tool is designed to:

- **Automate** PDF parsing of email receipts and credit-card statements  
- **Reduce** manual entry so you can focus on budgeting, not busywork  
- **Surface** your spending patterns with zero extra effort

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. **Automated Extraction**  
   - Connects securely to your Gmail via the Gmail API  
   - Scrapes transaction details from Instarem, Wise, and other email receipts  
   - Imports those entries directly into your dashboard  

2. **Recurring Transactions**  
   - Define any subscription, rent, or regular payment  
   - Automatically logs them on your chosen schedule  

3. **Manual Entry**  
   - For one-off expenses (e.g., peer-to-peer transfers, cash purchases)  
   - Simply fill out a quick formâ€”no PDF parsing needed
